Welcome to Recipe Cloud


Recipe Cloud is a web application for adding, sharing, and managing recipes and recipe ingredients. Users may upload their own recipes, 
or add others' recipes to their "Recipe Cloud". The primary data type stored in reach recipe is the recipe's ingredients. These ingredients
can be used to autopopulate a user's grocery list. When populating a grocery list, Recipe Cloud checks to see if the ingredients already exist, and 
if they do, Recipe Cloud totals the ingredients, and makes measurement conversions if necessary.

Recipe Cloud is built in NodeJS and Express, and uses a MongoDB database.
